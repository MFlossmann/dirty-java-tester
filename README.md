# dirty-java-tester
A quick and dirty python script to automatically test Java programs for Uni Freiburg's Advanced Programming (Java) course

Just put it in your "w0x" directory and execute it with "python3 djt.py". It should automatically find the classes you've written and test them.

If you don't have, nor want to install termcolor, simply download the no-color branch

# Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- termcolor (install with "pip3 install termcolor", considered, you have pip3)
